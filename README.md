# Making my own Linear Regression

This notebook goes into whats happeing behind the scenes whenever we use scikitlearn or other's Linear Regression function. I first start my making simple linear 
regression on a very easy to predict model, I then go into multivariate model (still somewhat easy data to build it off of) and make Linear Regression work for it as well. 
I finally created a generalized linear regression function that works with any number of independent variables to model their relationship with a dependent variable, 
and then I applied it to a real world dataset and compared the results with that of scikitlearn's. The results showed that my implementation produced outputs nearly identical 
to those of scikit-learn's. 

Concepts used for this include Gradient Descent, Multicollinearity, Correlation Matrix, etc.
